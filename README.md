# Apollo Cloud

Doesn't currently work on Docker Hub. Cross compilation didn't work out so well as it failed to install Apache2 so I decided to get rid of it. 
If you want to install this, just download the source repository and build from the Dockerfile manually.


This is the Apollo Cloud port the Raspberry Pi.

Apollo Cloud is a Python powered MP3 downloader, built off of [Craicerjack's apache-flask docker image] (https://hub.docker.com/r/craicerjack/apache-flask/), and [youtube-dl](https://rg3.github.io/youtube-dl/).
